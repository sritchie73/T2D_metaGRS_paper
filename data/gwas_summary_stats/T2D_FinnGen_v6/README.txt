GWAS Summary Statistics are available to download through Google Cloud Storage.

To access, researchers must first follow the instructions at 
https://finngen.gitbook.io/documentation/data-download
to register for access. At the time of download, this process involved providing
FinnGen with basic details on researcher identity (Name, Institution, Country, Email)
and access was approved automatically (i.e. immediately). 

Once registered, you will receive an email with instructions on how to access
the GWAS summary statistics through FinnGen's Google Cloud Storage. You will then
need to search for the trait of interest (in this case, DM2_STRICT) and click the
links to download.
